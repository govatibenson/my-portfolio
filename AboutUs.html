	<p>This is university-based team where we are aiming at mobilizing students who are zealous in the field of developing web sites, but dreams are there at expanding this to the entire world so this is just a begin.</p>
Some of the things we do to keep the team moving are as follows;

	<li>Encourage team members to present their projects, share their experiences, and discuss lessons learned. This promotes knowledge sharing, inspires creativity, and provides an opportunity for constructive feedback.</li>
	<li>Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards, optimize performance, and identify potential bugs or security vulnerabilities. Discuss best practices in areas such as code organization, documentation, testing, and version control.</li>
	<li>Allocate time for team members to bring up specific coding challenges they are facing. Collaboratively brainstorm solutions, share insights, and offer assistance to overcome obstacles.</li>
	<li>Invite industry professionals, alumni, or faculty members to deliver talks or workshops on topics relevant to web development, such as web security, user experience design, or project management methodologies. These sessions provide valuable insights and networking opportunities.</li>
